"Will Sreesanth win or lose this world cup? Depends which one of him turns up," says Skippy. Well here he is, bowling from over the wicket. He hasn't played since the opening game.

1.1
•
Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run
huge appeal for lbw first up, Aleem Dar says not out. That ball pitched on a length around leg stump. Dilshan went to smash it on the leg side and missed. That would have missed leg

1.2
2nb
Sreesanth to Dilshan, (no ball) 1 run
Dilshan gets tucked up by a length ball and plays on the leg side, Sreesanth had over-stepped and there's a free hit coming up ... India didn't concede an extra until very late in the innings against Pakistan. They've already conceded three today

1.2
1
Sreesanth to Upul Tharanga, 1 run
the free-hit is a well-directed delivery nearly in the blockhole, Tharanga digs it out on the on side and has broken the bat in his process, it will need changing

Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run
good length just outside off stump, punched from the crease towards cover point

1.4
2

Khan to Upul Tharanga, no run
another superb shot from Tharanga, he is timing it well already. He cuts a length ball from outside off but can't beat Yuvraj at point

2.3
•
Khan to Upul Tharanga, no run
a fuller ball outside off and Tharanga square drives fluently again, Yuvraj is in the way at point

2.4
•
Khan to Upul Tharanga, no run
Zaheer shortens his length a touch outside off and gets the ball to seam away from the left-hander a fraction, Tharanga began to push at it but let it go in the end

Sreesanth to Dilshan, 1 run
Dilshan opens the face and steers the ball towards third man

3.2
1
Sreesanth to Upul Tharanga, 1 run
that's some pretty sloppy work from India. Sreesanth didn't attempt to stop a mis-timed drive past him, Tendulkar ran towards his left from mid-on and missed the ball, mid off was covering though

3.3
•
Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run
played off the front foot towards the off side

3.4
•
Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run

3.6
•
Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run

4.3

4.4
•
Khan to Upul Tharanga, no run
Zaheer nearly conceded his first runs of the day but Yuvraj swooped to his left at point and cut off a wonderfully-timed square drive

4.5
•
Khan to Upul Tharanga, no run
Tharanga pushes forward at a good length ball round off and gets an outside edge that goes along the ground to Yuvraj at point

4.6
•
Khan to Upul Tharanga, no run
three maidens in a row from Zaheer, that is some start from India's ace. The last ball is on a good length and straight, forcing Tharanga to defend from the crease.

Sri Lanka need a release ... will Dilshan give it to them?

Sreesanth to Dilshan, FOUR runs

"What a change 8 years bring -- Zaheer in 2003 0/28 in 3 overs; in 2011 3 maidens in 3 overs.. Impressive even though bowling to Hayden/Gilly is different from bowling to Dilshan/Tharanga," says Sundar.

6.1
W
Khan to Upul Tharanga, OUT
caught at slip! And Zaheer hasn't conceded a run yet. Zaheer pitches the ball on a length around off, forcing Tharanga to prod because of his line as well as the pressure he's created, the ball nips away from the left-hander off the pitch and Tharanga edges it. The chance flies quickly to Sehwag's right at first slip and he takes it before falling to the ground

Patel to Dilshan, 2 runs
What's got into India's fielders today? This time Sreesanth runs fast to his right on the deep backward square leg boundary and dives full length to intercept a Dilshan flick off the pads. Did he touch that advertisement padding that doubles up as a boundary rope? Umpire Dar asks for replays and it's given as two runs

9.6
•
Patel to Sangakkara, no run
pushed off the front foot towards extra cover

This is just in: Replays of the toss indicate decisively that Sangakkara called heads the first time as well, and the call is audible to the television producers. In the noise, Dhoni mis-heard it as a 'tails' call. It was why he turned towards Shastri saying, "we'll bat." However neither Shastri nor Crowe had heard Sangakkara's call, Crowe due to the noise, while Shastri was looking up at the coin. Shastri looked across to Crowe, the referee said, "I didn't hear it." There was then a brief conversation and it was decided the  toss had to be held again.

Now then, it's time for spin. Here's Harbhajan with one over left in the powerplay.

Thanks George. It's been a good start from India but Sri Lanka have been steady, and with Sangakkara and Dilshan both starting to look good, this match is set up well. Personally, I reckon Kumar looks like he's wearing Donald Duck on his head, but there you go.

14.6
•
Harbhajan to Dilshan, no run
flicked back to Harbhajan on the bounce, a good, accurate start from the offspinner

It seems as though the broadcasters in Australia have lost interest in the World Cup, with the Australians having gone home. Here's Lawls: "Channel Nine are showing the cinematic masterpiece 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' instead of the World Cup Final. Cricket in Australia just got a little sicker. SHAME!"

Harbhajan to Dilshan, OUT
gone! Harbhajan gets Dilshan! It was a very leg-side delivery and Dilshan went for the sweep, got a bit of glove on the ball and it's lobbed back on to his leg and deflected on to the stumps! Oh dear, what a disappointment for Dilshan but full credit to Harbhajan for building that pressure.

well flighted by Harbhajan, and Jayawardene turns it through mid-on for another single

Madhu has this: " Dilshan became the fifth player to score 500 or more runs in a World Cup tournament. Sachin Tendulkar has done it twice in 1996 and 2003. Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting and Mahela Jayawardene are the others to achieve this feat. All three batsmen passed 500 runs in the 2007 World Cup."

So, Munaf Patel has bowled six overs for 18 runs. Outstanding work. In fact, Sreesanth in the latter stages of his opening spell is the only bowler to even slightly let India down so far.

Harbhajan to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs
good shot! Jayawardene gets a big stride forward and drives hard through point, all the way along the ground and finds the gap. The odd boundary will relieve some of the pressure building on Sri Lanka here.

edged and safe! And four, to add to Harbhajan's frustration! That was well flighted and straightened enough to get a genuine outside edge from Sangakkara, and the ball has fizzed through the vacant second slip region.

another boundary through slips! Not that there are any slips in for Sreesanth, and to be fair it looked like Jayawardene played that very deliberately, cutting late and opening the face to run it through third man. Well played.

Nirav: "Odd captaincy. Even without bowling sreesanth, the other 4 have enough overs between them to finish the innings. Why go to the part timers when they've done well the rest of the innings." Here is Zaheer Khan

Vishnu Udayan: "How on the GOD's green earth could you call Yuvi as a part timer?!" Ouch.

Yuvraj to Thilan Samaraweera, OUT
Yuvraj has a leg-before appeal turned down by umpire Taufel, and straightaway implores his captain to go for the review, Thilan went outside off stump on his knee for the big sweep, missed the delivery that went straight on with the angle, the question will be whether that hit him in line with off stump, it did, and is taking out middle stump, it is a rare occasion when umpire Taufel has to overturn his decision, this is one of them, and it is Yuvraj Singh for India again, he pushed Dhoni to go for the review

Gareth: "I question Kapugerera's place in the side. Surely there's a chandimal or someone who offers more with the bat. He's had 80-odd matches listed as a batter, and has failed to notch up one ton, even when his side needs him."

43.1

Patel to Kulasekara, no run
Kula misses the cut, Dhoni collects and immediately goes up for the catch, Munaf thinks he has got his man too, umpire Dar shakes his head, Dhoni wants another review, there seems to be no indication of an edge there, seemed like a review in hope rather than conviction, there was some sort of noise as the ball passed the bat, but that will not earn India a wicket

Sri Lanka have surged to 274, thanks to an elegantly effective century from Mahela Jayawardene. This will take lots of chasing, they have a terrific bowling attack. But the pitch has played true, these are the smallest boundaries at the Wankhede according to Ravi Shastri, and it can be done. This is also the big final, there will be pressure, lots of it, there will be a legend to tackle in Muttiah Muralitharan, and the yorkers of Lasith Malinga to deal with. Can India do it? They barely have twenty minutes to psyche themselves up. Join us for the final chase of this World Cup in some time. Nitin Sundar will take you through till the first drinks break. That will be it from me, Abhishek Purohit. I will see you all on the Chatterbox.

## Inning 2

6:50pm IST Thanks Abhishek. Boy, that was some innings from Mahela! The innings of the World Cup, possibly challenged only by KOB's blitz against England. Gilchrist and Ponting played classics in 2007 and 2003 finals... how good was this in comparison?

Sivabhaskar: "I've already started getting nightmares of a rain of in-swinging-yorkers -- Malinga !" and "A wicked kind of a compensation. Zaheer leaked at death what he contained at the birth."

Guru: "I know this is far-fetched, but think of it - Sachin getting his 100th 100 and winning the title for India, chasing a big total in a high-pressure final. How better can things get?" Well, so far this World Cup, India have managed to give their fans everything they wanted. This seems like the steepest demand of all, but who am I to bet against them pulling it off ...

Calvin: "I certainly don't see India getting these runs ,to win the world cup.As we can see there is some bounce in the wicket, which plays right into the hands of the Sri lankan's, bowlers." Debatable, Calvin. As far as I know, Sri Lanka's bowlers prefer slow and low pitches, not ones with good carry and little turn (which is how it has been so far). Plus, this is a small outfield. But, in a World Cup final, 274 is a mountain.

Mazher: "Mahela Jaywardene has never scored a century in losing cause, his all 13 centuries - before today - were match winning" Not sure if true, but if it is, that's a staggering stat ...

Swamy: "India's strategy has now been inverted thanks to that brilliant knock from Mahela. What happens in the first 15 overs will now dictate whether India win. Anything less than 100+ for no loss or 1 wicket means its SL's game."

Right, not much of a break. The players are out there. Sehwag is ready, Sachin's with him. The fielders are in position. Can Sehwag hit a first-ball four again? India need a lot of those. Won't be easy against Malinga. This is Nitin Sundar to start off commentary for the chase.

Malinga to Sehwag, no run
not a four. Short of a length outside off, Sehwag stays behind the line and punches into the covers

Two slips in place.

W
Malinga to Sehwag, OUT
Given out lbw, and immediately reviewed. Looks like a goner on replay! Back of a length delivery on middle stump, Sehwag was rising on the toes on leg stump line as it skidded through. He was on the hop as he closed the face and looked to flick. Misses the shot. Was there an inside edge? No evidence of that. Was that high? Not really - hit him under the roll. It's hitting middle. Three reds. Superb start for Sri Lanka! Sehwag top-scored for India in the 2003 final. Fair to say, he won't be the top scorer today.

Malinga to Gambhir, FOUR runs
Malinga smiles. Misfield at square leg. Fast and back of a length on leg stump, Gambhir calmly turns it away off the pads to the leg side, and the fielder at square leg dived over it.

Now, there are two men on square on the leg side. One catcher, another near the umpire.

0.4

Malinga to Gambhir, no run
oho, inside edge. Malinga gets one to curl in a touch from a length as Gambhir goes for a huge booming off-drive. Lucky to get some bat on it, onto the pad.

Malinga to Gambhir, no run
good looking shot for no run, Gambhir leans into a cover drive and gets it to race into the covers where Dilshan prowls and pounces on it,

•
Malinga to Gambhir, no run
the bouncer. It was a-coming with this field in place. Gambhir tries to ride the bounce, but is not entirely over it as he fends to the leg side.

Growler: 'Interesting stats. The team batting 2nd has only won 2 of 8 finals. The highest 2nd innings total in a final is 274 (Aus v. WI in 1975 off 60 overs). Aus lost. Statistically not looking good for India"

early signs, but Sachin's looking good. Short of a length on off stump, Sachin is decisively back as he punches into the covers. Dilshan tags it well and saves a run.

1
Kulasekara to Gambhir, 1 run
over-pitched outside off, driven without much timing wide of mid off for a single

Taking a review against him would be an Aleem Dare.

144 kph and again, not there for the drive outside off. Gambhir pushes firmly to mid off and pinches a single

There's a first slip and a widish third slip. And gully and short point, apart from covers.

•
Malinga to Tendulkar, no run
short of a length outside off, Sachin leans out for the on-the-up drive but ends up checking the shot.

2.4

Malinga to Tendulkar, no run
Malinga's hitting the bat hard here. 145 kph and not there to drive, Sachin meets it on the back foot and it pings off the blade with a loud thud for a defensive shot

2.5

Malinga to Tendulkar, 2 runs
the patent Sachin flick off the back foot, with an almost indiscernible turn of the wrists. Nicely finds the gap at midwicket and Murali fields after chasing.

2.6
2
Malinga to Tendulkar, 2 runs
top shot from Sachin. Superb adjustment. 145 kph and short of a length outside off, Sachin knows there are some 100 fielders on the off side, so moves across waits and opens the face to ease the steer between cover and point. The outfield seems to have slowed a bit, and he picks up a couple.

full length ball on off stump, he quietly pushes to mid off for one

Kulasekara to Tendulkar, 2 runs
Sachin threads the covers again. Dextrous. Kula sends down the legcutter on off stump and Sachin sees it nipping away, he waits and opens the face to get two more between cover and point.

Eswar: "This is Sachin's highest score in CWC finals! Go! Go! Go!" Ha!

Kulasekara to Tendulkar, FOUR runs
oh boy. We have seen some delightful shots today, and looks like we aren't done. Any doubts over who makes Sachin's bat? Just look at that replay for he shows the full face for a full couple of seconds. Short of a length on middle and off, Sachin leans out and meets it on top of the bounce and powers it past Kula.

3.4

Kulasekara to Tendulkar, no run
Kapu has saved a four at point. Sachin climbs into an on-the-up square drive and times it well, but Kapu pulls it down with a dive.

3.5

Kulasekara to Tendulkar, FOUR runs
another corker from Sachin. The first really loose ball of the night, just short enough and wide enough outside off for Sachin to pounce on with the cut. Enough to beat point moving to his left and third man to his right.

fullish ball but slanting across Gambhir who moves across well to steer towards point

4.2
•
Malinga to Gambhir, no run
144 kph on middle and leg, Malinga's release means the ball invariably always nips in towards the left hander's pads. Gambhir flicks viciously, but finds square leg.

another one short of driving length, 140 kph and angling across Gambhir who eases into a steer towards the covers

4.4

Malinga to Gambhir, 1 run
whoa, what happened there? It's clocked at 136 kph but seemed to come on very slowly at Gambhir who went for an on-drive with hard hands. It loops up menacingly but lands safe at short midwicket

4.6
•
Malinga to Tendulkar, no run
that's the first time Sachin's been beaten tonight. And he's beaten by pace. Short of a length at 140 kph, and hinting at going away from outside off as Sachin looks to jump across and square drive. It's through him by the time he plays the shot.

nicely played but superbly fielded. Short of a length offcutter on leg and middle, Gambhir flicks nicely backward of square leg but Randiv has it covered. He's a really good fielder.

another dot ball, no room or length for Gambhir who stays back on leg stump and tries to force into the off side. Can't get it past cover point

5.4

and again, slightly fuller but not there for the drive and Gambhir gets across to check-drive into the off side

5.5

Perera to Gambhir, FOUR runs
oho, Gambhir takes a chance and it pays off. He walks down the track and looks to carve over the off side, and times it really well. But it is in the air, and Kapu at point takes off to his left, but he can't get a hand to it.

Malinga to Tendulkar, OUT
The ball that silenced a billion. Most of Wankhede is silent. Some of it is very noisy, and has Sri Lankan flags waving away in a frenzy. Sachin's World Cup is over. No 100th 100 today. Malinga gets another over, another go at a wicket, and he responds with a wicket. It's that patent back of a length ball outside off and as always, Malinga got it to go away. Sachin tried the same shot, last ball of the previoius Malinga over, trotting across and looking for the steer through the off side. This time he edged it, and though it was dying on Sanga, he wasn't going to put it down. He dives to the right and comes up with the biggest wicket of the World Cup.

the kid is still having fun though! Perera helps the cause by tossing a candy on the pads, Gambhir surreptitiously wolfs it down to fine leg with a crisp flick. Fifty stand up, Wankhede begins to make some noise as India go into the drinks break after a minor recovery.

Time for me then, to hand over the commentary duties to Brydon Coverdale. Cheers.

Dilshan to Kohli, OUT
Dilshan! He's taken a blinder off his own bowling! Kohli drives and tries to get it back past the bowler, towards long-on, but Dilshan just sticks his right hand up in the air, almost in front of the non-striker's face, and plucks a magnificent catch! Could that be a decisive moment? It could very well be!

Dilshan to Dhoni, 1 bye
Dhoni tries for a drive here and can't get bat on ball, it also beats Sangakkara, who couldn't taken it cleanly. And it may have been a missed stumping, as Dhoni seemed to have dragged his foot out of the crease. Even if he'd taken it cleanly, though, he'd have to have whipped the bails off like lightning.

Perera to Gambhir, OUT
No 100. "Needless shot," says Ravi Shastri on air and you can't argue with that. It was the shot for the crowds. He rushed down the track, got outside leg and went for the slog. Misses. Clatter! What a knock it has been so far, though. Under pressure, Gautam has delivered. BUt has he let the door slightly ajar now with that shot? He had the chance to slam it shut on the opposition but he has given them a whiff now. Wankhede crowd stands to applaud this knock in a World-cup final chase.

Thunderous wallop! Start the tuk tuk indeed. A stunning crashing blow to achieve it. It was a full delivery and Dhoni has sent the white ball flying over long-on. Indian contingent have gone mad. The dressing room erupts with joy. Dhoni had a poor batting record in World cups. 34 was his highest. And what does he do? He promotes himself and has played a fine knock to pull this off. Yuvraj envelops him with a hug. What a knock from Gautam Gambhir and Dhoni. Spare a thought for Mahela Jayawardene who unfurled a sublime knock to set up this target. It's India's night though. It's Dhoni's night. India are the world champions.


Good bye and good luck.

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is now holding that cup that eluded him for so many years. And he screams in joy. What a night.

We shall leave you with this final image.

BCCI has announced that 1 crore to each team-member of the Indian squad. Gary Kirsten and his support staff get rs 50 lakh each. The selectors get 25 lakh each. Show me the money!

Dhoni gets the cup, the team is with him in the podium and fireworks begin. The Indian team roar and roar. They pose for the pictures.

Dhoni: "I took a quite few decisions tonight, if we hadn't won I would have been asked quite a few questions: Why no Ashwin, Why sreesanth. Why no Yuvraj, Why did I bat ahead?! That pushed me and motivated to do well.The pressure had got to me in the previous games. In this game, I wanted to bat up the order and Gary backed me and by the senior players. I had a point to prove to myself. Virat and Gautam batted brillantly; lots of singles. Then with the help of bit of dew , we put pressure on the spinners. I would have liked Gautam to go on and get that big hundred."

The Indian team step out to collect their winning medals. As ever, its Tendulkar who brings the roof down.

Man of the tournament Yuvraj Singh: "This is unbelievable. Under-19 World cup, then Twenty20 but this is the most special. For Sachin, for everyone else. I want to dedicate this to my guru ji, for my mother and my friends. Last time we were in World-cup final, we made lots of mistakes. Batting second is lot of pressure but Gauti and MS played outstandingly. They played like it was a normal game. We batted like champions. We don;t have a proper left-arm spinner and so it was my job to do it. Narendra Hirwani has been helping me and I have been working hard. Tonight is going to be good night! Thank you India!"

Sangakkara: "Very proud of everyone, especially Mahela who rose up to the occasion and put up a great hundred. When you look at this Indian team anything less than 350 looks less! They deserved this title, the way they played in front of a great crowd. Both Sri Lanka and India will be proud with the way they have played. Thanks to Sri Lankan fans. Congrats India, you were the better side today. The only way to stop India is to get atleast 7 wickets. Gautam was outstanding and Dhoni stepped up and performed."

The Sri Lankan team come one by one to accept the medals. Crowd cheer. Huge roar for Malinga but the biggest is for Muttiah Muralitharan. Great cheers for Sanga as well.

Player of the tournament is Yuvraj Singh.

Man of the match is Dhoni

Yuvraj :" It was for Tendulkar. We did it!"

ZAheer: "I can't explain this feeling. It's for this special man (tendulkar)."

Tendulkar: "Couldn't have asked for anything more than this. Winning the world cup is the proudest moment of my life. Thanks to my team-mates. Without them, nothing would have happened. I couldn't control my tears of joy. Thanks to the support staff. Thanks to Mike Horn, who has helped with the expectations and pressure. The team stuck together in the rough phases and proved people wrong who doubted our ability. Self belief has been always there but in the last two years, we have been very consistent. It's been great honour to be part of this team. Thanks to Gary and Paddy Upton.

Virat Kohli: "This goes out to all the people of India. THis is my first world cup; I can't ask for more. Tendulkar has carried the burden of nation for 21 years; It was time we carried him. Chak de India!"

Harbhajan singh: " It means the world to me. I have been part of the three world-cups. This is for the nation. Thank you very much, we love you. This cup is for the people. Love you India!"

The Sri Lankan camp troop out. Murali is in conversation with Sanga who looks on at a distance, at nothing in particular.

And now its Gary Kirsten's time to be hoisted on the shoulders. Virat and Raina again are the men. Kirsten is up and laughing. Gary gets down now.

Now Yusuf Pathan and Raina carry Tendulkar. The whole team is behind them, with them. At the back, are the support staff: Gary Kirsten, Eric Simons and the whole lot. Zaheer takes time out to rush to them and he walks with them. Out in the front, Tendulkar is still being lifted and carried by his admiring team-mates. Sehwag puts a hand around Dhoni and Gambhir. And now finally, Tendulkar gets down to the ground. He immediately spreads the Indian flag.

Meanwhile Tendulkar is being carried on the shoulders of Virat Kohli. Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Harbhajan hold him from the side. The team takes the victory lap. Tendulkar holds the Indian flag aloft. He can't stop smiling. He checks with Kohli and Raina, who are carry8ing him, whether they are ok. More laughter. He stays on top. The lap continues. The flag waves. The crowd roar.

Gambhir: "All credit goes to Sachin Tendulkar. We played for him. Beating Australia and Pakistan and now this, its a dream come true."

The Sri Lankans slowly get back to the pavilion. The Indian huddle is on the ground. They hop and jump in joy. Harbhajan is crying. With the Indian flag in hand. Yusuf pathan hugs him. He is still crying. Last tIme Sri Lanka won the tournament, and beat India, one Indian cricketer left the arena in tears of sorrow. Now it's the opposite. Crazy scenes out there. Camera pans to Dhoni who has his cap pulled down, his right arm wipes off some sweat. slowly he looks up and high-fives with a team-mate. Gary Kirsten is out there. All smiles.

Sachin Tendulkar comes out running with that lovely smile. Dhoni has been lifted by couple of players. Gautam Gambhir, the man who played that icy-cool knock under pressure, is also there. Every one is hugging each other. The fire works are in display. Yuvraj hugs Gambhir and ruffles his hair. They scream. Tears of joy from Yuvraj.
