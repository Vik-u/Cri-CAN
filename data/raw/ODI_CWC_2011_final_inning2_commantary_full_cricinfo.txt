6:50pm IST Thanks Abhishek. Boy, that was some innings from Mahela! The innings of the World Cup, possibly challenged only by KOB's blitz against England. Gilchrist and Ponting played classics in 2007 and 2003 finals... how good was this in comparison?

Sivabhaskar: "I've already started getting nightmares of a rain of in-swinging-yorkers -- Malinga !" and "A wicked kind of a compensation. Zaheer leaked at death what he contained at the birth."

Guru: "I know this is far-fetched, but think of it - Sachin getting his 100th 100 and winning the title for India, chasing a big total in a high-pressure final. How better can things get?" Well, so far this World Cup, India have managed to give their fans everything they wanted. This seems like the steepest demand of all, but who am I to bet against them pulling it off ...

Calvin: "I certainly don't see India getting these runs ,to win the world cup.As we can see there is some bounce in the wicket, which plays right into the hands of the Sri lankan's, bowlers." Debatable, Calvin. As far as I know, Sri Lanka's bowlers prefer slow and low pitches, not ones with good carry and little turn (which is how it has been so far). Plus, this is a small outfield. But, in a World Cup final, 274 is a mountain.

Mazher: "Mahela Jaywardene has never scored a century in losing cause, his all 13 centuries - before today - were match winning" Not sure if true, but if it is, that's a staggering stat ...

Swamy: "India's strategy has now been inverted thanks to that brilliant knock from Mahela. What happens in the first 15 overs will now dictate whether India win. Anything less than 100+ for no loss or 1 wicket means its SL's game."

Right, not much of a break. The players are out there. Sehwag is ready, Sachin's with him. The fielders are in position. Can Sehwag hit a first-ball four again? India need a lot of those. Won't be easy against Malinga. This is Nitin Sundar to start off commentary for the chase.

Malinga to Sehwag, no run
not a four. Short of a length outside off, Sehwag stays behind the line and punches into the covers

Two slips in place.

W
Malinga to Sehwag, OUT
Given out lbw, and immediately reviewed. Looks like a goner on replay! Back of a length delivery on middle stump, Sehwag was rising on the toes on leg stump line as it skidded through. He was on the hop as he closed the face and looked to flick. Misses the shot. Was there an inside edge? No evidence of that. Was that high? Not really - hit him under the roll. It's hitting middle. Three reds. Superb start for Sri Lanka! Sehwag top-scored for India in the 2003 final. Fair to say, he won't be the top scorer today.

Leg gully in place.

Gambhir walks out. Sachin maintains a zen-like focus at the non-striker's end.

Malinga to Gambhir, FOUR runs
Malinga smiles. Misfield at square leg. Fast and back of a length on leg stump, Gambhir calmly turns it away off the pads to the leg side, and the fielder at square leg dived over it.

Now, there are two men on square on the leg side. One catcher, another near the umpire.

0.4
•
Malinga to Gambhir, no run
oho, inside edge. Malinga gets one to curl in a touch from a length as Gambhir goes for a huge booming off-drive. Lucky to get some bat on it, onto the pad.

0.5

Malinga to Gambhir, no run
good looking shot for no run, Gambhir leans into a cover drive and gets it to race into the covers where Dilshan prowls and pounces on it,

Malinga to Gambhir, no run
the bouncer. It was a-coming with this field in place. Gambhir tries to ride the bounce, but is not entirely over it as he fends to the leg side.

Growler: 'Interesting stats. The team batting 2nd has only won 2 of 8 finals. The highest 2nd innings total in a final is 274 (Aus v. WI in 1975 off 60 overs). Aus lost. Statistically not looking good for India"

Kulasekara to Tendulkar, 1 run

1.2

hmm, Gambhir is dealing in inside edges for now. Kula gets one to come in seemingly innocuously from a length around off stump as Gambhir presses into a drive. Edged to the leg wide.

Kulasekara to Gambhir, 1 run
over-pitched outside off, driven without much timing wide of mid off for a single

Taking a review against him would be an Aleem Dare.

top shot from Sachin. Superb adjustment. 145 kph and short of a length outside off, Sachin knows there are some 100 fielders on the off side, so moves across waits and opens the face to ease the steer between cover and point. The outfield seems to have slowed a bit, and he picks up a couple.

Malinga to Tendulkar, no run
that's the first time Sachin's been beaten tonight. And he's beaten by pace. Short of a length at 140 kph, and hinting at going away from outside off as Sachin looks to jump across and square drive. It's through him by the time he plays the shot.

Malinga to Tendulkar, OUT
The ball that silenced a billion. Most of Wankhede is silent. Some of it is very noisy, and has Sri Lankan flags waving away in a frenzy. Sachin's World Cup is over. No 100th 100 today. Malinga gets another over, another go at a wicket, and he responds with a wicket. It's that patent back of a length ball outside off and as always, Malinga got it to go away. Sachin tried the same shot, last ball of the previoius Malinga over, trotting across and looking for the steer through the off side. This time he edged it, and though it was dying on Sanga, he wasn't going to put it down. He dives to the right and comes up with the biggest wicket of the World Cup.

Kohli drives and tries to get it back past the bowler, towards long-on, but Dilshan just sticks his right hand up in the air, almost in front of the non-striker's face, and plucks a magnificent catch! Could that be a decisive moment? It could very well be!

And it may have been a missed stumping, as Dhoni seemed to have dragged his foot out of the crease. Even if he'd taken it cleanly, though, he'd have to have whipped the bails off like lightning.

Meanwhile, Dhoni is getting slowly ready. Not sure whether he has a back problem or something else. He drinks some water, spits some, has a chat, and a laugh, with Gambhir.

Circe Magnifica: " Don't be so sure: I woudn't put it beyond the reach of the famous Great Indian Collapsing Trick to make this appear as one-sided as a floor within a couple of overs. "

Umair: "@Prashant: Fight? What India is doing at the moment is anythign but fight. They are just cool. Even SriLanka is not showing any fight ;). "

Dhoni is struggling in pain there Some back problem. He is down on the ground. Physio is out there. Now he gets up and gets ready.

No 100. "Needless shot," says Ravi Shastri on air and you can't argue with that. It was the shot for the crowds. He rushed down the track, got outside leg and went for the slog. Misses. Clatter! What a knock it has been so far, though. Under pressure, Gautam has delivered. BUt has he let the door slightly ajar now with that shot? He had the chance to slam it shut on the opposition but he has given them a whiff now. Wankhede crowd stands to applaud this knock in a World-cup final chase.

Thunderous wallop! Start the tuk tuk indeed. A stunning crashing blow to achieve it. It was a full delivery and Dhoni has sent the white ball flying over long-on. Indian contingent have gone mad. The dressing room erupts with joy. Dhoni had a poor batting record in World cups. 34 was his highest. And what does he do? He promotes himself and has played a fine knock to pull this off. Yuvraj envelops him with a hug. What a knock from Gautam Gambhir and Dhoni. Spare a thought for Mahela Jayawardene who unfurled a sublime knock to set up this target. It's India's night though. It's Dhoni's night. India are the world champions.


Good bye and good luck.

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is now holding that cup that eluded him for so many years. And he screams in joy. What a night.

We shall leave you with this final image.

BCCI has announced that 1 crore to each team-member of the Indian squad. Gary Kirsten and his support staff get rs 50 lakh each. The selectors get 25 lakh each. Show me the money!

Dhoni gets the cup, the team is with him in the podium and fireworks begin. The Indian team roar and roar. They pose for the pictures.

Dhoni: "I took a quite few decisions tonight, if we hadn't won I would have been asked quite a few questions: Why no Ashwin, Why sreesanth. Why no Yuvraj, Why did I bat ahead?! That pushed me and motivated to do well.The pressure had got to me in the previous games. In this game, I wanted to bat up the order and Gary backed me and by the senior players. I had a point to prove to myself. Virat and Gautam batted brillantly; lots of singles. Then with the help of bit of dew , we put pressure on the spinners. I would have liked Gautam to go on and get that big hundred."

The Indian team step out to collect their winning medals. As ever, its Tendulkar who brings the roof down.

Man of the tournament Yuvraj Singh: "This is unbelievable. Under-19 World cup, then Twenty20 but this is the most special. For Sachin, for everyone else. I want to dedicate this to my guru ji, for my mother and my friends. Last time we were in World-cup final, we made lots of mistakes. Batting second is lot of pressure but Gauti and MS played outstandingly. They played like it was a normal game. We batted like champions. We don;t have a proper left-arm spinner and so it was my job to do it. Narendra Hirwani has been helping me and I have been working hard. Tonight is going to be good night! Thank you India!"

Sangakkara: "Very proud of everyone, especially Mahela who rose up to the occasion and put up a great hundred. When you look at this Indian team anything less than 350 looks less! They deserved this title, the way they played in front of a great crowd. Both Sri Lanka and India will be proud with the way they have played. Thanks to Sri Lankan fans. Congrats India, you were the better side today. The only way to stop India is to get atleast 7 wickets. Gautam was outstanding and Dhoni stepped up and performed."

The Sri Lankan team come one by one to accept the medals. Crowd cheer. Huge roar for Malinga but the biggest is for Muttiah Muralitharan. Great cheers for Sanga as well.

Player of the tournament is Yuvraj Singh.

Man of the match is Dhoni

Yuvraj :" It was for Tendulkar. We did it!"

ZAheer: "I can't explain this feeling. It's for this special man (tendulkar)."

Tendulkar: "Couldn't have asked for anything more than this. Winning the world cup is the proudest moment of my life. Thanks to my team-mates. Without them, nothing would have happened. I couldn't control my tears of joy. Thanks to the support staff. Thanks to Mike Horn, who has helped with the expectations and pressure. The team stuck together in the rough phases and proved people wrong who doubted our ability. Self belief has been always there but in the last two years, we have been very consistent. It's been great honour to be part of this team. Thanks to Gary and Paddy Upton.

Virat Kohli: "This goes out to all the people of India. THis is my first world cup; I can't ask for more. Tendulkar has carried the burden of nation for 21 years; It was time we carried him. Chak de India!"

Harbhajan singh: " It means the world to me. I have been part of the three world-cups. This is for the nation. Thank you very much, we love you. This cup is for the people. Love you India!"

The Sri Lankan camp troop out. Murali is in conversation with Sanga who looks on at a distance, at nothing in particular.

And now its Gary Kirsten's time to be hoisted on the shoulders. Virat and Raina again are the men. Kirsten is up and laughing. Gary gets down now.

Now Yusuf Pathan and Raina carry Tendulkar. The whole team is behind them, with them. At the back, are the support staff: Gary Kirsten, Eric Simons and the whole lot. Zaheer takes time out to rush to them and he walks with them. Out in the front, Tendulkar is still being lifted and carried by his admiring team-mates. Sehwag puts a hand around Dhoni and Gambhir. And now finally, Tendulkar gets down to the ground. He immediately spreads the Indian flag.

Meanwhile Tendulkar is being carried on the shoulders of Virat Kohli. Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Harbhajan hold him from the side. The team takes the victory lap. Tendulkar holds the Indian flag aloft. He can't stop smiling. He checks with Kohli and Raina, who are carry8ing him, whether they are ok. More laughter. He stays on top. The lap continues. The flag waves. The crowd roar.

Gambhir: "All credit goes to Sachin Tendulkar. We played for him. Beating Australia and Pakistan and now this, its a dream come true."

The Sri Lankans slowly get back to the pavilion. The Indian huddle is on the ground. They hop and jump in joy. Harbhajan is crying. With the Indian flag in hand. Yusuf pathan hugs him. He is still crying. Last tIme Sri Lanka won the tournament, and beat India, one Indian cricketer left the arena in tears of sorrow. Now it's the opposite. Crazy scenes out there. Camera pans to Dhoni who has his cap pulled down, his right arm wipes off some sweat. slowly he looks up and high-fives with a team-mate. Gary Kirsten is out there. All smiles.

Sachin Tendulkar comes out running with that lovely smile. Dhoni has been lifted by couple of players. Gautam Gambhir, the man who played that icy-cool knock under pressure, is also there. Every one is hugging each other. The fire works are in display. Yuvraj hugs Gambhir and ruffles his hair. They scream. Tears of joy from Yuvraj.
