"Will Sreesanth win or lose this world cup? Depends which one of him turns up," says Skippy. Well here he is, bowling from over the wicket. He hasn't played since the opening game.

1.1
•
Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run
huge appeal for lbw first up, Aleem Dar says not out. That ball pitched on a length around leg stump. Dilshan went to smash it on the leg side and missed. That would have missed leg

2nb
Sreesanth to Dilshan, (no ball) 1 run
Dilshan gets tucked up by a length ball and plays on the leg side, Sreesanth had over-stepped and there's a free hit coming up ... India didn't concede an extra until very late in the innings against Pakistan. They've already conceded three today

1.2
1
Sreesanth to Upul Tharanga, 1 run
the free-hit is a well-directed delivery nearly in the blockhole, Tharanga digs it out on the on side and has broken the bat in his process, it will need changing

Khan to Upul Tharanga, OUT
caught at slip! And Zaheer hasn't conceded a run yet. Zaheer pitches the ball on a length around off, forcing Tharanga to prod because of his line as well as the pressure he's created, the ball nips away from the left-hander off the pitch and Tharanga edges it. The chance flies quickly to Sehwag's right at first slip and he takes it before falling to the ground

What's got into India's fielders today? This time Sreesanth runs fast to his right on the deep backward square leg boundary and dives full length to intercept a Dilshan flick off the pads. Did he touch that advertisement padding that doubles up as a boundary rope? Umpire Dar asks for replays and it's given as two runs

This is just in: Replays of the toss indicate decisively that Sangakkara called heads the first time as well, and the call is audible to the television producers. In the noise, Dhoni mis-heard it as a 'tails' call. It was why he turned towards Shastri saying, "we'll bat." However neither Shastri nor Crowe had heard Sangakkara's call, Crowe due to the noise, while Shastri was looking up at the coin. Shastri looked across to Crowe, the referee said, "I didn't hear it." There was then a brief conversation and it was decided the  toss had to be held again.

Now then, it's time for spin. Here's Harbhajan with one over left in the powerplay.

Thanks George. It's been a good start from India but Sri Lanka have been steady, and with Sangakkara and Dilshan both starting to look good, this match is set up well. Personally, I reckon Kumar looks like he's wearing Donald Duck on his head, but there you go.

It seems as though the broadcasters in Australia have lost interest in the World Cup, with the Australians having gone home.

gone! Harbhajan gets Dilshan! It was a very leg-side delivery and Dilshan went for the sweep, got a bit of glove on the ball and it's lobbed back on to his leg and deflected on to the stumps! Oh dear, what a disappointment for Dilshan but full credit to Harbhajan for building that pressure.

Madhu has this: " Dilshan became the fifth player to score 500 or more runs in a World Cup tournament. Sachin Tendulkar has done it twice in 1996 and 2003. Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting and Mahela Jayawardene are the others to achieve this feat. All three batsmen passed 500 runs in the 2007 World Cup."

Harbhajan to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs
good shot! Jayawardene gets a big stride forward and drives hard through point, all the way along the ground and finds the gap. The odd boundary will relieve some of the pressure building on Sri Lanka here.

edged and safe! And four, to add to Harbhajan's frustration! That was well flighted and straightened enough to get a genuine outside edge from Sangakkara, and the ball has fizzed through the vacant second slip region.

another boundary through slips! Not that there are any slips in for Sreesanth, and to be fair it looked like Jayawardene played that very deliberately, cutting late and opening the face to run it through third man. Well played.

Nirav: "Odd captaincy. Even without bowling sreesanth, the other 4 have enough overs between them to finish the innings. Why go to the part timers when they've done well the rest of the innings." Here is Zaheer Khan

Vishnu Udayan: "How on the GOD's green earth could you call Yuvi as a part timer?!" Ouch.

Yuvraj to Thilan Samaraweera, OUT
Yuvraj has a leg-before appeal turned down by umpire Taufel, and straightaway implores his captain to go for the review, Thilan went outside off stump on his knee for the big sweep, missed the delivery that went straight on with the angle, the question will be whether that hit him in line with off stump, it did, and is taking out middle stump, it is a rare occasion when umpire Taufel has to overturn his decision, this is one of them, and it is Yuvraj Singh for India again, he pushed Dhoni to go for the review

Gareth: "I question Kapugerera's place in the side. Surely there's a chandimal or someone who offers more with the bat. He's had 80-odd matches listed as a batter, and has failed to notch up one ton, even when his side needs him."

43.1
•
Patel to Kulasekara, no run
Kula misses the cut, Dhoni collects and immediately goes up for the catch, Munaf thinks he has got his man too, umpire Dar shakes his head, Dhoni wants another review, there seems to be no indication of an edge there, seemed like a review in hope rather than conviction, there was some sort of noise as the ball passed the bat, but that will not earn India a wicket

43.2

Patel to Kulasekara, no run
pushed back to the bowler

43.3

slower one outside off, he stays in the crease and pushes it to point

Sri Lanka have surged to 274, thanks to an elegantly effective century from Mahela Jayawardene. This will take lots of chasing, they have a terrific bowling attack. But the pitch has played true, these are the smallest boundaries at the Wankhede according to Ravi Shastri, and it can be done. This is also the big final, there will be pressure, lots of it, there will be a legend to tackle in Muttiah Muralitharan, and the yorkers of Lasith Malinga to deal with. Can India do it? They barely have twenty minutes to psyche themselves up. Join us for the final chase of this World Cup in some time. Nitin Sundar will take you through till the first drinks break. That will be it from me, Abhishek Purohit. I will see you all on the Chatterbox.
