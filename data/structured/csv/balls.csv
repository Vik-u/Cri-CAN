Dhoni had a poor batting record in World cups. 34 was his highest. And what does he do? He promotes himself and has played a fine knock to pull this off. Yuvraj envelops him with a hug. What a knock from Gautam Gambhir and Dhoni. Spare a thought for Mahela Jayawardene who unfurled a sublime knock to set up this target. It's India's night though. It's Dhoni's night. India are the world champions.
Good bye and good luck.
Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is now holding that cup that eluded him for so many years. And he screams in joy. What a night.
We shall leave you with this final image.
BCCI has announced that 1 crore to each team-member of the Indian squad. Gary Kirsten and his support staff get rs 50 lakh each. The selectors get 25 lakh each. Show me the money!
Dhoni gets the cup, the team is with him in the podium and fireworks begin. The Indian team roar and roar. They pose for the pictures.
Dhoni: ""I took a quite few decisions tonight, if we hadn't won I would have been asked quite a few questions: Why no Ashwin, Why sreesanth. Why no Yuvraj, Why did I bat ahead?! That pushed me and motivated to do well.The pressure had got to me in the previous games. In this game, I wanted to bat up the order and Gary backed me and by the senior players. I had a point to prove to myself. Virat and Gautam batted brillantly; lots of singles. Then with the help of bit of dew , we put pressure on the spinners. I would have liked Gautam to go on and get that big hundred.""
The Indian team step out to collect their winning medals. As ever, its Tendulkar who brings the roof down.
Man of the tournament Yuvraj Singh: ""This is unbelievable. Under-19 World cup, then Twenty20 but this is the most special. For Sachin, for everyone else. I want to dedicate this to my guru ji, for my mother and my friends. Last time we were in World-cup final, we made lots of mistakes. Batting second is lot of pressure but Gauti and MS played outstandingly. They played like it was a normal game. We batted like champions. We don;t have a proper left-arm spinner and so it was my job to do it. Narendra Hirwani has been helping me and I have been working hard. Tonight is going to be good night! Thank you India!""
Sangakkara: ""Very proud of everyone, especially Mahela who rose up to the occasion and put up a great hundred. When you look at this Indian team anything less than 350 looks less! They deserved this title, the way they played in front of a great crowd. Both Sri Lanka and India will be proud with the way they have played. Thanks to Sri Lankan fans. Congrats India, you were the better side today. The only way to stop India is to get atleast 7 wickets. Gautam was outstanding and Dhoni stepped up and performed.""
The Sri Lankan team come one by one to accept the medals. Crowd cheer. Huge roar for Malinga but the biggest is for Muttiah Muralitharan. Great cheers for Sanga as well.
Player of the tournament is Yuvraj Singh.
Man of the match is Dhoni
Yuvraj :"" It was for Tendulkar. We did it!""
ZAheer: ""I can't explain this feeling. It's for this special man (tendulkar).""
Tendulkar: ""Couldn't have asked for anything more than this. Winning the world cup is the proudest moment of my life. Thanks to my team-mates. Without them, nothing would have happened. I couldn't control my tears of joy. Thanks to the support staff. Thanks to Mike Horn, who has helped with the expectations and pressure. The team stuck together in the rough phases and proved people wrong who doubted our ability. Self belief has been always there but in the last two years, we have been very consistent. It's been great honour to be part of this team. Thanks to Gary and Paddy Upton.
Virat Kohli: ""This goes out to all the people of India. THis is my first world cup; I can't ask for more. Tendulkar has carried the burden of nation for 21 years; It was time we carried him. Chak de India!""
Harbhajan singh: "" It means the world to me. I have been part of the three world-cups. This is for the nation. Thank you very much, we love you. This cup is for the people. Love you India!""
The Sri Lankan camp troop out. Murali is in conversation with Sanga who looks on at a distance, at nothing in particular.
And now its Gary Kirsten's time to be hoisted on the shoulders. Virat and Raina again are the men. Kirsten is up and laughing. Gary gets down now.
Now Yusuf Pathan and Raina carry Tendulkar. The whole team is behind them, with them. At the back, are the support staff: Gary Kirsten, Eric Simons and the whole lot. Zaheer takes time out to rush to them and he walks with them. Out in the front, Tendulkar is still being lifted and carried by his admiring team-mates. Sehwag puts a hand around Dhoni and Gambhir. And now finally, Tendulkar gets down to the ground. He immediately spreads the Indian flag.
Meanwhile Tendulkar is being carried on the shoulders of Virat Kohli. Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Harbhajan hold him from the side. The team takes the victory lap. Tendulkar holds the Indian flag aloft. He can't stop smiling. He checks with Kohli and Raina, who are carry8ing him, whether they are ok. More laughter. He stays on top. The lap continues. The flag waves. The crowd roar.
Gambhir: ""All credit goes to Sachin Tendulkar. We played for him. Beating Australia and Pakistan and now this, its a dream come true.""
The Sri Lankans slowly get back to the pavilion. The Indian huddle is on the ground. They hop and jump in joy. Harbhajan is crying. With the Indian flag in hand. Yusuf pathan hugs him. He is still crying. Last tIme Sri Lanka won the tournament, and beat India, one Indian cricketer left the arena in tears of sorrow. Now it's the opposite. Crazy scenes out there. Camera pans to Dhoni who has his cap pulled down, his right arm wipes off some sweat. slowly he looks up and high-fives with a team-mate. Gary Kirsten is out there. All smiles.
Sachin Tendulkar comes out running with that lovely smile. Dhoni has been lifted by couple of players. Gautam Gambhir, the man who played that icy-cool knock under pressure, is also there. Every one is hugging each other. The fire works are in display. Yuvraj hugs Gambhir and ruffles his hair. They scream. Tears of joy from Yuvraj."

Sri Lanka have surged to 274, thanks to an elegantly effective century from Mahela Jayawardene. This will take lots of chasing, they have a terrific bowling attack. But the pitch has played true, these are the smallest boundaries at the Wankhede according to Ravi Shastri, and it can be done. This is also the big final, there will be pressure, lots of it, there will be a legend to tackle in Muttiah Muralitharan, and the yorkers of Lasith Malinga to deal with. Can India do it? They barely have twenty minutes to psyche themselves up. Join us for the final chase of this World Cup in some time. Nitin Sundar will take you through till the first drinks break.

Yuvraj envelops him with a hug. What a knock from Gautam Gambhir and Dhoni. Spare a thought for Mahela Jayawardene who unfurled a sublime knock to set up this target. It's India's night though. It's Dhoni's night. India are the world champions.
Good bye and good luck.
Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is now holding that cup that eluded him for so many years. And he screams in joy. What a night.
We shall leave you with this final image.
BCCI has announced that 1 crore to each team-member of the Indian squad. Gary Kirsten and his support staff get rs 50 lakh each. The selectors get 25 lakh each. Show me the money!
Dhoni gets the cup, the team is with him in the podium and fireworks begin. The Indian team roar and roar. They pose for the pictures.
Dhoni: ""I took a quite few decisions tonight, if we hadn't won I would have been asked quite a few questions: Why no Ashwin, Why sreesanth. Why no Yuvraj, Why did I bat ahead?! That pushed me and motivated to do well.The pressure had got to me in the previous games. In this game, I wanted to bat up the order and Gary backed me and by the senior players. I had a point to prove to myself. Virat and Gautam batted brillantly; lots of singles. Then with the help of bit of dew , we put pressure on the spinners. I would have liked Gautam to go on and get that big hundred.""
The Indian team step out to collect their winning medals. As ever, its Tendulkar who brings the roof down.
Man of the tournament Yuvraj Singh: ""This is unbelievable. Under-19 World cup, then Twenty20 but this is the most special. For Sachin, for everyone else. I want to dedicate this to my guru ji, for my mother and my friends. Last time we were in World-cup final, we made lots of mistakes. Batting second is lot of pressure but Gauti and MS played outstandingly. They played like it was a normal game. We batted like champions. We don;t have a proper left-arm spinner and so it was my job to do it. Narendra Hirwani has been helping me and I have been working hard. Tonight is going to be good night! Thank you India!""
Sangakkara: ""Very proud of everyone, especially Mahela who rose up to the occasion and put up a great hundred. When you look at this Indian team anything less than 350 looks less! They deserved this title, the way they played in front of a great crowd. Both Sri Lanka and India will be proud with the way they have played. Thanks to Sri Lankan fans. Congrats India, you were the better side today. The only way to stop India is to get atleast 7 wickets. Gautam was outstanding and Dhoni stepped up and performed.""
The Sri Lankan team come one by one to accept the medals. Crowd cheer. Huge roar for Malinga but the biggest is for Muttiah Muralitharan. Great cheers for Sanga as well.
Player of the tournament is Yuvraj Singh.
Man of the match is Dhoni
Yuvraj :"" It was for Tendulkar. We did it!""
ZAheer: ""I can't explain this feeling. It's for this special man (tendulkar).""
Tendulkar: ""Couldn't have asked for anything more than this. Winning the world cup is the proudest moment of my life. Thanks to my team-mates. Without them, nothing would have happened. I couldn't control my tears of joy. Thanks to the support staff. Thanks to Mike Horn, who has helped with the expectations and pressure. The team stuck together in the rough phases and proved people wrong who doubted our ability. Self belief has been always there but in the last two years, we have been very consistent. It's been great honour to be part of this team. Thanks to Gary and Paddy Upton.
Virat Kohli: ""This goes out to all the people of India. THis is my first world cup; I can't ask for more. Tendulkar has carried the burden of nation for 21 years; It was time we carried him. Chak de India!""
Harbhajan singh: "" It means the world to me. I have been part of the three world-cups. This is for the nation. Thank you very much, we love you. This cup is for the people. Love you India!""
The Sri Lankan camp troop out. Murali is in conversation with Sanga who looks on at a distance, at nothing in particular.
And now its Gary Kirsten's time to be hoisted on the shoulders. Virat and Raina again are the men. Kirsten is up and laughing. Gary gets down now.
Now Yusuf Pathan and Raina carry Tendulkar. The whole team is behind them, with them. At the back, are the support staff: Gary Kirsten, Eric Simons and the whole lot. Zaheer takes time out to rush to them and he walks with them. Out in the front, Tendulkar is still being lifted and carried by his admiring team-mates. Sehwag puts a hand around Dhoni and Gambhir. And now finally, Tendulkar gets down to the ground. He immediately spreads the Indian flag.
Meanwhile Tendulkar is being carried on the shoulders of Virat Kohli. Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Harbhajan hold him from the side. The team takes the victory lap. Tendulkar holds the Indian flag aloft. He can't stop smiling. He checks with Kohli and Raina, who are carry8ing him, whether they are ok. More laughter. He stays on top. The lap continues. The flag waves. The crowd roar.
Gambhir: ""All credit goes to Sachin Tendulkar. We played for him. Beating Australia and Pakistan and now this, its a dream come true.""
The Sri Lankans slowly get back to the pavilion. The Indian huddle is on the ground. They hop and jump in joy. Harbhajan is crying. With the Indian flag in hand. Yusuf pathan hugs him. He is still crying. Last tIme Sri Lanka won the tournament, and beat India, one Indian cricketer left the arena in tears of sorrow. Now it's the opposite. Crazy scenes out there. Camera pans to Dhoni who has his cap pulled down, his right arm wipes off some sweat. slowly he looks up and high-fives with a team-mate. Gary Kirsten is out there. All smiles.
Sachin Tendulkar comes out running with that lovely smile. Dhoni has been lifted by couple of players. Gautam Gambhir, the man who played that icy-cool knock under pressure, is also there. Every one is hugging each other. The fire works are in display. Yuvraj hugs Gambhir and ruffles his hair. They scream. Tears of joy from Yuvraj."
