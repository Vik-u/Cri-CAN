Now then, it's time for spin. Here's Harbhajan with one over left in the powerplay.
Thanks George. It's been a good start from India but Sri Lanka have been steady, and with Sangakkara and Dilshan both starting to look good, this match is set up well. Personally, I reckon Kumar looks like he's wearing Donald Duck on his head, but there you go."

Now then, it's time for spin. Here's Harbhajan with one over left in the powerplay.
Thanks George. It's been a good start from India but Sri Lanka have been steady, and with Sangakkara and Dilshan both starting to look good, this match is set up well. Personally, I reckon Kumar looks like he's wearing Donald Duck on his head, but there you go."

VInod: ""Brilliant to see India's very Aussie-like fightback, sensible batting and MSD playing a captain's knock after a long time at this crucial juncture. Sensational!""
Meanwhile, Dhoni is getting slowly ready. Not sure whether he has a back problem or something else. He drinks some water, spits some, has a chat, and a laugh, with Gambhir.
Circe Magnifica: "" Don't be so sure: I woudn't put it beyond the reach of the famous Great Indian Collapsing Trick to make this appear as one-sided as a floor within a couple of overs. ""
Umair: ""@Prashant: Fight? What India is doing at the moment is anythign but fight. They are just cool. Even SriLanka is not showing any fight ;). ""
Dhoni is struggling in pain there Some back problem. He is down on the ground. Physio is out there. Now he gets up and gets ready."
