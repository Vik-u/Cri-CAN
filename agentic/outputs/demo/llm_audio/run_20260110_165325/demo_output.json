Dilshan follows, swivelling to pull a short ball for another run. The next ball sees Sangakkara strike a tidy drive but no runs as the ball hits the ground. He then hits a full length that goes straight down the ground, again no runs, and on the final ball he stays in front of the stumps, defending as the ball swings away.",

A quick single follows off a clipped shot through the leg side, and Jayawardene turns a soft single behind square. Yuvraj pulls a shot that swings past him and it's taken behind - a clean catch to bring the wicket down. Samaraweera replies with a defensive toss up outside off, settling for a dot.",
