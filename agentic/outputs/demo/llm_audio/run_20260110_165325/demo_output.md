innings: 1
over: 6
text: Upul Tharanga is caught at slip as Zaheer delivers a length ball, his first wicket of the day. Sangakkara starts the reply, dabbing a quick single off the same bowler. Dilshan follows, swivelling to pull a short ball for another run. The next ball sees Sangakkara strike a tidy drive but no runs as the ball hits the ground. He then hits a full length that goes straight down the ground, again no runs, and on the final ball he stays in front of the stumps, defending as the ball swings away.

innings: 1
over: 27
text: Sangakkara pulls a tidy 2 through deep cover as he drifts just outside off and takes a bit of width, then unleashes a brilliant footwork-driven four, clipping the ball between mid-on and mid-wicket for a boundary. A quick single follows off a clipped shot through the leg side, and Jayawardene turns a soft single behind square. Yuvraj pulls a shot that swings past him and it's taken behind - a clean catch to bring the wicket down. Samaraweera replies with a defensive toss up outside off, settling for a dot.
