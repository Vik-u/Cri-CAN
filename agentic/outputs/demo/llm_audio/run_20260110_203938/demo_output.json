Upul Tharanga\ndeparts, and Khan has the breakthrough. Sangakkara scores the first run off Zaheer by dabbing towards mid-on and setting off at top speed. Short ball and\nDilshan swivels and pulls towards the fielder on the deep square leg boundary. Sangakkara strides forward and drives a length ball from outside off to the\nfielder at cover, nicely timed. Good ball from Khan, Sangakkara can't score. Short of a length and straight, Sangakkara gets behind the line and defends. End of\nover 7: 2 runs, 1 wicket (Upul Tharanga).",
