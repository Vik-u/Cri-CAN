Zaheer pitches the ball on a length around off, forcing Tharanga to prod because of his line as well as\nthe pressure he's created, the ball nips away from the left-hander off the pitch and Tharanga edges it. The chance flies quickly to Sehwag's right at first slip\nand he takes it before falling to the ground Upul Tharanga c Sehwag b Khan 2 (20b 0x4 0x6 30m) SR: 10 KuMar Sangakkara, the captain, is next in . Sangakkara\nscores the first run off Zaheer by dabbing towards mid-on and setting off at top speed. short ball and Dilshan swivels and pulls towards the fielder on the deep\nsquare leg boundary.

Sreesanth beats Dilshan's attempt\nat a booming drive on the up with a delivery that pitches short of a length outside off and bounces nicely, that was measured at 145.3 kph. and again! Dilshan\nreleases the pressure by cutting a short and wide ball from outside off to the backward point boundary. Loose ball, put away. tighter line and length closer to\noff stump, Dilshan punches towards cover. Dilshan tries to drive through the line on the front foot but doesn't make good contact with a length delivery on off,\nhe plays that to mid-off. a touch slower and a lot straighter around middle and off, Dilshan tries to drive again but slices it towards point.",

    "text": "Six over point! Wankhede goes mental! It was the shortish delivery outside off and Dhoni hopped, rode the bounce and played a superbly wicked cut over point.\nThe white ball kept flying. Almost run out! It was jabbed, off bat and pad, to point and the ball rolled to point. Yuvraj dashed across for the single, Dhoni\ntook couple of steps and then stopped. He then decided to rush across and boy did he rush or what? He makes it in time to beat the throw from point. leans\nforward to turn to the leg side for a single. in the zone outside off and Dhoni jabs and stabs and the ball rushes past the edge. slower, on the middle, turned\nto midwicket. Yuvraj is standing on the practice track close to the centre pitch! Not at the other end. Not damp there. short in length, extra bounce on that\none and Dhoni adjusts to shove it to cover.",

Classy. clipped away through the leg side for a single. soft\nhands now as Jayawardene turns this one behind square. gone! Caught behind trying to cut! Yuvraj pushed this one across Sangakkara, whose eyes lit up as he went\nhard at the shot and got an edge through to Dhoni, who made no mistake.

This will take lots of chasing, they have a terrific bowling attack.\nBut the pitch has played true, these are the smallest boundaries at the Wankhede according to Ravi Shastri, and it can be done. This is also the big final,\nthere will be pressure, lots of it, there will be a legend to tackle in Muttiah Muralitharan, and the yorkers of Lasith Malinga to deal with. Can India do it?\nThey barely have twenty minutes to psyche themselves up. Join us for the final chase of this World Cup in some time. Nitin Sundar will take you through till the\nfirst drinks break. That will be it from me, Abhishek Purohit. I will see you all on the Chatterbox.",
