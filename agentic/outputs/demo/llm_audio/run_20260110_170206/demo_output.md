innings: 1
over: 6
text: caught at slip! And Zaheer hasn't conceded a run yet. Zaheer pitches the ball on a length around off, forcing Tharanga to prod because of his line as well as
the pressure he's created, the ball nip. Sangakkara scores the first run off Zaheer by dabbing towards mid-on and setting off at top speed. short ball and
Dilshan swivels and pulls towards the fielder on the deep square leg boundary. Sangakkara strides forward and drives a length ball from outside off to the
fielder at cover, nicely timed. shot! Stopped! Sangakkara lashed a full ball off the front foot, making superb contact with the cover drive, Raina was in the
way at cover. short of a length and straight, Sangakkara gets behind the line and defends.

## boundary_four_only
match_id: CWC_2011_final_ALL
innings: 1
over: 5
text: and there it is! A touch too short and Dilshan dismisses it with a pull off the front foot, hit in the air but over midwicket. Sreesanth beats Dilshan's attempt
at a booming drive on the up with a delivery that pitches short of a length outside off and bounces nicely, that was measured at 145.3 kph. and again! Dilshan
releases the pressure by cutting a short and wide ball from outside off to the backward point boundary. Loose ball, put away. tighter line and length closer to
off stump, Dilshan punches towards cover. Dilshan tries to drive through the line on the front foot but doesn't make good contact with a length delivery on off,
he plays that to mid-off. a touch slower and a lot straighter around middle and off, Dilshan tries to drive again but slices it towards point.

## boundary_six_only
match_id: CWC_2011_final_ALL
innings: 2
over: 43
text: Six over point! Wankhede goes mental! It was the shortish delivery outside off and Dhoni hopped, rode the bounce and played a superbly wicked cut over point.
The white ball kept flying. Almost run out! It was jabbed, off bat and pad, to point and the ball rolled to point. Yuvraj dashed across for the single, Dhoni
took couple of steps and then stopped. He then decided to rush acro. leans forward to turn to the leg side for a single. in the zone outside off and Dhoni jabs
and stabs and the ball rushes past the edge. slower, on the middle, turned to midwicket. Yuvraj is standing on the practice track close to the centre pitch! Not
at the other end. Not damp there. short in length, extra bounce on that one and Dhoni adjusts to shove it to cover.

## wicket_and_boundary
match_id: CWC_2011_final_ALL
innings: 1
over: 27
text: driven through cover as Sangakkara gets a bit of width outside off, and Tendulkar is sweeping on the boundary. super stroke! Sangakkara uses his feet, gets down
the pitch and clips Yuvraj between mid-on and midwicket and it's timed and placed to perfection. Classy. clipped away through the leg side for a single. soft
hands now as Jayawardene turns this one behind square. gone! Caught behind trying to cut! Yuvraj pushed this one across Sangakkara, whose eyes lit up as he went
hard at the shot and got an edge through to Dhoni, who made no mistake. What a massive blow. tossed up outside off and Samaraweera reaches forward to defend.

## four_and_six
match_id: CWC_2011_final_ALL
innings: 1
over: 49
text: Zaheer bowls one full on the stump, and Thisara smokes it down to long off, absolutely smoked. Zaheer follows Mahela down the leg side with a yorker, but Mahela
is in such good touch that he manages to squeeze it late to short third man. serves up a low full around off stump, and thisara makes some room, and whacks it
past extra cover for another boundary, that is what you do in the batting Powerplay, take full toll of it. that is why Kula came in ahead of Thisara, who can
take off in these end overs, gets a full delivery, and launches it with a powerful swing, and the ball just beats a leaping mid on. super commitment from
Mahela, it was slogged wide of deep midwicket, Mahela pushed Thisara for the second, and backed up his intentions with a screaming dive to get in the crease. 63
runs off the batting Powerplay, 22 off 9 for Thisara, gets a fuller delivery in his swinging zone, swivels, and hammers it over deep square leg for maximum Sri
Lanka have surged to 274, thanks t.
